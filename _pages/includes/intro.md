I am Yihe (Jordan) Zhang, currently a CS PhD student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am luckily advised by [Prof. Zhiling Lan](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/lan-zhiling/) and [Prof. Michael E. Papka](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/papka-michael/). 

Previously, I obtained my Master degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and my Bachelor degree at Nanjing Tech University. I was very lucky to be advised by [Prof. Xiaodong Yu](https://xiaodong-yu.github.io/) at Stevens Institute of Technology last summer.

My research interests are mainly in High-Performance Computing and AI4sys.

I like soccer and basketball, my favorite soccer team is LIVERPOOL FC, and my favorite basketball team is GSW.

Please contact me if you are interested in my research, [yihe6@uic.edu](mailto:yihe6@uic.edu).
