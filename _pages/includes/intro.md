I am Yihe (Jordan) Zhang, currently a CS PhD student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am luckily advised by [Prof. Zhiling Lan](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/lan-zhiling/) and [Prof. Michael E. Papka](https://cs.uic.edu/profiles/papka-michael/). 

Previously, I obtained my Master degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and my Bachelor degree at Nanjing Tech University. I also worked with [Prof. Xiaodong Yu](https://xiaodong-yu.github.io/) at Stevens Institute of Technology during 2024 summer.

My research interests are mainly High-Performance Computing and AI4sys, especially for power/enegery-aware job scheduling in large-scale computing systems.

Please contact me if you are interested in my research, my email is [yihe6@uic.edu](mailto:yihe6@uic.edu).
